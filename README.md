Dataset Management
Recommended Dataset Directory
Use a cloud service like Google Drive to manage datasets and test images efficiently.

Instructions to Link Google Drive
Use Google Driveâ€™s Python API or a library like pydrive or google.colab (if working in Colab).
Ensure your dataset is uploaded under the datasets directory.
Modify the script to load datasets directly from the Drive:

from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
DATASET_PATH = '/content/drive/My Drive/datasets/age_gender_data'

File Directory Recommendations

Advantages of Using Google Drive
Accessibility: Access your data from any device or location.
Scalability: Easily expand your storage without affecting your local machine.
Backup: Secure your dataset and images with automatic syncing.
Sharing: Effortlessly collaborate by sharing specific folders.
